# Multi-Functional AI-Powered NLP Tool

## 📌 Description
This project is a Python-based Command Line Interface (CLI) application that
integrates Google Gemini Generative AI to perform intelligent text processing
tasks. The application includes a basic user authentication system (Register
and Login) and provides multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) features
such as sentiment analysis, language translation, and language detection.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how Generative AI APIs can be
combined with clean Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) design to build
real-world AI-powered applications.
